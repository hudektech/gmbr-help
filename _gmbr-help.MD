### Setup 1: Enter your courses

- Breakout Rooms Extension is organized by courses. The first step is to enter your courses in the "Courses" tab.

  ![Enter Course](./data/setup1.png)

- It is possible to use this extension with just ONE course. You do not need to add multiple courses if you do not want to. If you want to run all your classes through one set of google links which are organized by that one course, you certainly can.
- Multiple courses option is so that teachers may assign certain links to different classes, perhaps on a more permanent basis. Separating them into different courses may make it easier to manage, but it is not a requirement. You can just use ONE course if you want to.
- To highlight the entire contents of an input box, please triple click. This will highlight everything so you can copy/paste or delete.
- To add a row, please click on the green + button
- To save, click on the blue save button
- Please note that all courses must have a unique name
- The red delete button deletes from the bottom up so if you want to delete a course then use drag and drop the move the course to the bottom of the list and then click on the red delete button
- The export/import button which is the far right hand side black button. This will export all of your data from the extension to your pc download folder so that you can import it into a second computer. Or if you want a backup in case you need to uninstall the exension, you can first export the data to your pc so that you can import it after you re-install the extension.

- The breakout rooms are created in the Rooms tab

  ![Enter Course](./data/setup2.0.png)

- :smile: **By far the simplest way to use this extension is to leave the "Nickname, Code, URL" link field blank.** Create your rows of rooms, give each room a unique name and then click on the save button. The extension will create the links for you. Most people do not use nicknames, codes, or resource URLs. If you want a quickstart and get up and running then just do this: create rows of rooms with unique name, leave the link field blank, and then click on the save button. You're done! Now you have all the rooms you need and can move on to the next step.

  ![create rooms](data/setup2.1.png)

- Google Classroom Teachers: Please copy and paste your "Meet link" from your google classroom page into the link field for your Main room. An example of a Google Classroom meet link is https://meet.google.com/lookup/g45j4fubqb. There is no separate Start Class with Google Classroom section. The sync is automatic if the main room is opened within the extension. If you open first in Google Classroom, then you will sync in the Start section of the Meet tab by clicking on the Open/Sync Main room button there.

- Types of links:

  - _Nickname_: Nicknames are dynamic because their meet urls change for each session. You may enter any value in the link field as your nickname, but please enter the nickname itself and do not include any prefix such as g.co/meet/ or meet.google.com/lookup/. Nicknames are color coded light green. Nicknames have the advantage that they expire soon after the session concludes with all participants and the teacher exiting the room. In addition, for new sessions the nickname creates new links.

  - _Google Classroom Nicknames_: Google Classroom nicknames are also dynamic because their meet urls change for each session. You may enter the entire "meet link" from the Google Classroom web page which looks up the 10 character system generated google classroom nickname. An example of a Google Classroom meet link is https://meet.google.com/lookup/g45j4fubqb. In this example, the 10 character system generated nickname is g45j4fubqb. You may enter either the full meet link or just the 10 character nickname. They both work the same.

    You may also create user defined Google Classroom nicknames. A user defined Google Classroom nickname is the lookup prefix followed by a user defined nickname. An example is https://meet.google.com/lookup/smith_algrebra_1. Alternatively you may more simply enter just the nickname, smith_algebra_1

  - _Code_: Codes are static because they always call up the same meet url. A code is a total of 12 characters which consists of the 10 character meet code plus the 2 dashes, in a 3-4-3 format. A code is the 12 characters after the https://meet.google.com/ in the meet url. Static meet urls may be desireable if you want to keep the same link for your sessions

  - _Meet Url_: Meet Urls are static because they always call up the same meet url, however, there is a checkbox setting which can make these dynamic by creating new meet urls "on the fly" each time the room is opened. The meet url is the full https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij formatted address. You may leave the field blank if you want the extension to automatically create one for you. There is no need to go to the Calendar

    To make meet urls dynamic you may click the "Automatically create links each time the room is opened" checkbox in the Settings. This checkbox is only relevant for meet urls. The checkbox is ignored for all other categories such as nicknames, codes, and resource urls.

  - _Resource Url_: This may be any web page that the teacher wants to use as a teaching resource, such as a science page, nature website, or a youtube to name a few examples.

### Setup 3: Customize your Settings

- Tabs/Tiles: This controls whether the breakout rooms each have their own window (tiles) or if they are separate tabs in a window (tabs). The tabs option can control the number of tabs within a window
  ![create rooms](data/setup3.png)

- Colors: Customize the bottom border of your Google Meet

- Automatically Allow Outside Participants to enter: This allows participants from outside your organization to automatically enter your room without your approval. If you check this box then if the participant has the link then they can automatically enter the room. This is the equivalent of allowing yourself to be zoom bombed. It is a huge convenience to allow outside participants to enter breakout rooms if they have the link but there is the possibility that an unrecognized person who has this link may enter. The default is Off (not checked). Recommendation is to leave it off to prevent outsiders from entering without your approval.

- Slider and Broadcast Background Images: [Video tutorial]() Choose an URL for an image or leave it blank and just choose a background color ("Back Color"). Font colors can be changed for light and dark background, as well as the position and size of the images

- Automatically Join Meet: [Video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AHaEjdP5vg) Only meets whose URL is listed in the rooms tab may be eligible for an automatic join. For "eligible" meets, this automatic join function can be turned on or off by clicking or leaving the checkbox for the Main room and Breakout rooms. All meets with URLs that are not listed in the Rooms tab will not be automatically joined.

- Automatically refresh room links when opened: [Video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU7cMYNKrww) If the checkbox is selected then new room links will be created on-demand, whenever the Open button is clicked. This saves the teacher the steps of going to the Rooms tab, blanking out the rooms' links, and clicking save in order to get a fresh set of room links. Now the teacher can choose to have the rooms automatically generate brand new links when the Open room button is clicked.

- There is a checkbox for the Main room and the Breakout rooms, so each category is separately configureable. For example, if the teacher wants to keep the Main room link static but have the Breakout rooms links dynamically refreshed each time, then the teacher can deselect (not check) the Main room checkbox but check the Breakout rooms checkbox.

### Teach Class 1: Select course and number of rooms

> [Click here for video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmS62uhUts)

- On the Meet tab, click on the section "Start Class"

- Use the dropdowns for Course and Breakouts to choose your course and desired number of breakout rooms.

  ![meet tab](./data/use1a.png)

- You may either click on "Main room" button and just open the main room, or click on "Both" to open the main room plus all of the breakout rooms.
- If you first decided to only open the main room, you can always change you mind and open the breakouts later, by clicking on the "Breakouts" button.
- If you click on "Both" while the main room is already open, or while some breakouts are already open, no worries. These rooms will not be opened twice.
- During class you can change the number of breakout rooms, so please don't worry that you need to decide this ahead of time. If you increase the number of breakout rooms then when you click to open "Breakouts" the extension will only open the breakouts that are not yet open. For example, if you first start out the class with 3 breakouts and later decide to add 2 more, then you may change the number of breakouts to 5 and click Open Breakouts. Just those 2 unopened rooms will be opened.
- :warning: Please do not click on the checkbox "Low Memory Option" unless your computer has a very small amount of memory. If you check this box, then only one breakout room window will be displayed at a time. If you accidentally check this box, no worries. Just uncheck it and then choose your button option: Main, Breakouts, or Both
- :point-right: To reorganize your tiled windows, after they are opened please click on the Red Re-tile button on the top right hand side of the control panel
